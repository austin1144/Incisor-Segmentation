# Incisor-Segmentation
For this project, a total of 30 panoramic dental radiographs will be made available. 
From this set, 14 radiographs have ground truth segmentations, together with homologous landmarks. 

# Project-Description
In  forensic  investigations,  dental  records  are  often  relied  upon  to  accurately identify deceased persons. Manual comparison of ante8mortem and post mortem records, however, is a tedious and time consuming job. Automating this process would save the investigators a lot of time. The first step towards a comparison is segmentation of  the  teeth. The goal of  this project  is  to develop a model based 
segmentation approach, capable of segmenting  the upper and  lower  incisors  in panoramic radiographs.
